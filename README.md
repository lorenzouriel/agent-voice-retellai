## Example Conversations

### Product Search
```
User: "Hi"
Assistant: "Hello! Welcome to VAIB — handcrafted cosmetics made with care.
How can I help you today? Do you want to search for a product,
ask questions, or check an order?"
```

### Stock Inquiry
```
User: "Do you have a body scrub for dry skin?"
Assistant: "Yes — we have a scrub indicated for dry skin that leaves
the skin soft and well-hydrated. Would you like me to tell you
the ingredients and how to use it?"
```

### Human Handoff
```
User: "I want to speak with a human agent"
Assistant: "Sure — no problem. I can transfer you to our human
support team via WhatsApp. Would you like me to send a message
now so we can start the service?"
```

## Best Practices

- Maintain customer confidentiality

### Conversation Quality
- Keep responses concise and natural
- Use natural pauses in speech
- Avoid technical jargon
- Be patient with unclear requests
- Offer alternatives when something isn't possible
